# Predicting Rain in Seattle

This notebook aims to predict a classic classification problem regarding whether or not it will rain in Seattle using both logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors model. The data is available at the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND%3aUSW00024233/detail). There are 70 years worth of data, so it should be enough for building our models.
